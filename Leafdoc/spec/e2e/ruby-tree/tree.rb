require 'tree/tree_deps'

# This module provides a *TreeNode* class whose instances are the primary
# objects for representing nodes in the tree.
#
# This module also acts as the namespace for all classes in the *RubyTree*
# package.
module Tree

  # üçÇclass TreeNode
  #
  # This class models the nodes for an *N-ary* tree data structure. The
  # nodes are *named*, and have a place-holder for the node data (i.e.,
  # _content_ of the node). The node names are required to be *unique*
  # amongst the sibling/peer nodes. Note that the name is implicitly
  # used as an _ID_ within the data structure).
  #
  # The node's _content_ is *not* required to be unique across
  # different nodes in the tree, and can be +nil+ as well.
  #
  # The class provides various methods to navigate the tree, traverse
  # the structure, modify contents of the node, change position of the
  # node in the tree, and to make structural changes to the tree.
  #
  # A node can have any number of *child* nodes attached to it and
  # hence can be used to create N-ary trees.  Access to the child
  # nodes can be made in order (with the conventional left to right
  # access), or randomly.
  #
  # The node also provides direct access to its *parent* node as well
  # as other superior parents in the path to root of the tree.  In
  # addition, a node can also access its *sibling* nodes, if present.
  #
  # Note that while this implementation does not _explicitly_ support
  # directed graphs, the class itself makes no restrictions on
  # associating a node's *content* with multiple nodes in the tree.
  # However, having duplicate nodes within the structure is likely to
  # cause unpredictable behavior.

    # üçÇsection Core Attributes

    # üçÇproperty name: String|Integer
    #
    # Name of this node.  Expected to be unique within the tree.
    #
    # Note that the name attribute really functions as an *ID* within
    # the tree structure, and hence the uniqueness constraint is
    # required.
    #
    # This may be changed in the future, but for now it is best to
    # retain unique names within the tree structure, and use the
    # `content` attribute for any non-unique node requirements.
    #
    # If you want to change the name, you probably want to call [`rename`](#treenode-rename)
    # instead.

    attr_reader   :name

    # üçÇproperty content
    # Content of this node.  Can be `nil`.  Note that there is no
    # uniqueness constraint related to this attribute.
    attr_accessor :content

    # üçÇproperty parent: TreeNode; Parent of this node.  Will be `nil` for a root node.
    attr_reader   :parent

    # üçÇmethod root(): TreeNode
    # Gets the root node for the (sub)tree to which this node belongs.
    # A root node's root is itself.
    def root
      root = self
      root = root.parent until root.is_root?

    # Returns `true` if this is a root node.  Note that
    # orphaned children will also be reported as root nodes.

    # üçÇsection Node Creation

    # üçÇmethod initialize(name: String|Integer, content):nil
    # Creates a new node with a name and optional content.
    # The node name is expected to be unique within the tree.
    #
    # The content can be of any type, and defaults to `nil`.
    #
    # Note: If the name is an `Integer`, then the semantics of {#[]} access
    #   method can be surprising, as an `Integer` parameter to that method
    #   normally acts as an index to the children array, and follows the
    #   _zero-based_ indexing convention.
    #
    def initialize(name, content = nil)
      raise ArgumentError, 'Node name HAS to be provided!' if name == nil

             'Using integer as node name.'\

    # üçÇmethod add(child: TreeNode, at_index: Integer=1):TreeNode
    #
    # Adds the specified child node to this node.
    #
    # This method can also be used for *grafting* a subtree into this
    # node's tree, if the specified child node is the root of a subtree (i.e.,
    # has child nodes under it).
    #
    # this node becomes parent of the node passed in as the argument, and
    # the child is added as the last child ("right most") in the current set of
    # children of this node.
    #
    # Additionally you can specify a insert position. The new node will be
    # inserted BEFORE that position. If you don't specify any position the node
    # will be just appended. This feature is provided to make implementation of
    # node movement within the tree very simple.
    #
    # If an insertion position is provided, it needs to be within the valid
    # range of:
    #
    #    -children.size..children.size
    #
    # This is to prevent `nil` nodes being created as children if a non-existent
    # position is used.
    #
    # If the new node being added has an existing parent node, then it will be
    # removed from this pre-existing parent prior to being added as a child to
    # this node. I.e., the child node will effectively be moved from its old
    # parent to this node. In this situation, after the operation is complete,
    # the node will no longer exist as a child for its old parent.
